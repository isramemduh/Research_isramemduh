           &nbsp &nbsp Encryption is the technique used to convert a plain text message into cipher text which is unreadable to human or machine. 
         Encryption is of two types, namely: symmetric key encryption and asymmetric key encryption. Encryption scheme in which both the sender
           and receiver share the same key is referred to as symmetric key encryption scheme. <br>
         Encryption scheme in which encryption and decryption are performed using different keys, i.e. a public key and a private key is referred to as asymmetric key encryption scheme.
         
          This paper presents a performance comparison between four popular and commonly used encryption algorithms:
            
          Data Encryption Standard (DES), Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA). DES, 3DES, and AES are symmetric key encryption algorithms while RSA is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm.
          
         The comparative analysis is carried out based on their Architecture, Scalability, Flexibility, Reliability, Security and Limitation that are essential for secured communication (Wired or Wireless).
         
          The results achieved form a baseline in choosing an encryption algorithm that is more efficient and that have strength against cryptanalysis.
